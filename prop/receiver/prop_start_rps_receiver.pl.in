#  Start the rps receiver process to read the rps_prop mail queue 
#  and move the submitted proposals to the official ASCDS_PROP_RPS_RECV
#  directory.  Log the incoming proposals in the received_proposal.log
#  for viewing by the User Support Group.
#
#  Any output from system commands is appended to the prop_rps_receiver log.
