How to install PIMMS
====================

The gzip'ed tar file is available at
	https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/software/tools/pimms4_10a.tar.gz

After downloading this file into a suitable directory,

% tar zxvf pimms4_10a.tar.gz

should create four subdirectories: data, models, sample and source.

Goto the source subdirectory and edit the file called 'sitespec.inc'
so that ddir_name correctly points to the data, and mdir_name
to the models subdirectory.

% make arch=linux

The makefile allows for linux, darwin (Mac OS X), solaris, alpha, sun (for
pre-Solaris SunOS), and dec (Ultrix), although recent versions have not
been tested on many of the legacy systems.  PIMMS does not make extensive
use of sstem dependent features, so it should work, possibly with some
effort, on all UNIX and UNIX-like systems.  The make command will leave
the executable, pimms, in the directory above source; there you can find
the LaTeX documentation file pimms.tex.

On some systems, it may be necessary to insert a line specifying the fortran
compiler (e.g., "FC = gfortran") in the Makefile.
