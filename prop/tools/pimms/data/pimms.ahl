Minimum abbreviation: M                                                         Examples: "MO PL 1.7 3e21" "MO mymodel.dat"                                                                                                                     Model specifies the spectral shape to be folded  with the effective area curve  of the instrument.  Starting with version 3.0, up to 8 model components can be  added together to represent multi-temperature plasma,  power law plus Gaussian  emission line, partial-covering absorber etc.   Only a limited combinations of  models have been rigorously tested;   users of complicated models are urged to  check the composite model by using the OUTPUT command.                                                                                                          As components, PIMMS recognizes  BLACKBODY, POWERLAW, BREMSSTRAHLUNG, GAUSSIAN  and PLASMA.  If the model name string does  not match these, PIMMS will try to  interpret the string  as a file name containing  a precalculated  model         containing energy, photon flux pairs (see EXTERNAL_MODELS; MODELS_DIRECTORY).   Nh, the equivalent neutral hydrogen column density  (using Morrison & McCammon  model) is expected for each component, except for GAUSSIAN and external files.  Nh should be specified in full with an appropriate exponent (e.g., 2.5e21), or  as a small non-zero number less than 30.0, to be intepreted as log10(Nh).                                                                                       Model normalization for the built-in models do not necessarily correspond to    physical quantities.  Instead, PIMMS is designed to allow users to compare 2    observable quantities (count rates through specific instruments, or fluxes in   specific energy bands) without having to know the model normalization.                                                                                          Optionally,  all components may be redshifted using a common z (in which case,  all component Nh are interpreted as intrinsic absorber, with the same z)  with  an optional Galactic NH.                                                                 0          11          10                                              The Model commands takes 1-8 blocks of component specification, and a final     optional block of redshift specification.  Each block starts with a valid       name of a component (including a valid file name), followed by a set of         numerical parameters.  As a special case, the plasma model takes an             optional string ('logt' or 'kev', the latter being the default) specifying      the unit of temperature, immediately after the numerical parameter for the      temperature (in keV or in logT as appropriate).  For 2nd through 8th            component blocks, additional parameter(s) specifying the ratio of that          component to component 1, and the reference energy at which this is to          be evaluated, must also be given (NB the reference energy for Gaussian          is always its central energy).                                                           0           2          10                                              MODEL command  with a question mark  (or no  parameters) will return a short    listing of available models.                                                             0           1          10                                              Can be abbreviated to "BL.." or "BB".

Parameter is photon index  (flux in    photon/cm/cm/s is E**-(index)). This version allows power laws that increase    with increasing energy --- enter negative 'index'.                                                                                                              A power law with high energy cutoff E**-(index)*exp[(Ecut-E)/Eefold] can be     specified by typing "model pl 1.5 13.5 20.0 1e22" for example --- this will     result in an index of 1.5, cut-off energy of 13.5 and e-folding energy          of 20 keV, with an Nh of 1E22.                                                           0          20          10                                              Can be abbreviated to "PLA..".  PIMMS relies on grids of pre-calculated         files, using the APEC (default), mekal, and Raymond-Smith codes.  Since         v4.0, PIMMS has been distributed with APEC and Raymond-Smith models at 59       temperature (logT of 5.60 to 8.50 in an increment of 0.05) times 5 abundance    (0.2 to 1.0 in an increment of 0.2), while mekal has a narrower temperature     range starting with logT of 6.0 (51 tempertures to logT=8.50).  The syntax is   "model plasma <kT> <abun> <nh>" (e.g., "model plasma 3.5 0.8 3e20").            The temperature can be specified in logT as adding the word "logt" after        the first numerical parameter, which is then taken to be logT. Starting in      V4.7, APEC model files calculated using ATOMDB version 2.0.2 in XSPEC           version 12.8.1g on 2013 Dec 9-11, assuming the solar abundances due to          Asplund M et al. 2009, ARAA, 47, 481, are included. Between V4.0 and V4.6b,     APEC files generated using ATOMDB 1.3.1 assuming Anders & Grevesse were         included. Current mekal model files also assume Anders & Grevesse solar         abundances, while the solar standard for the Raymond-Smith grid has become      unclear due to passage of time.  PIMMS will select the nearest temperature      and abundance that is supported by the grid in use.                                                                                                             At start-up, the plasma model in use is APEC.  The alternatives can be          selected by issuing the PLASMA command.                                                  0           9          10                                              Can be abbreviated to "G".  This model takes the central energy and physical    width (in keV) as parameters, and optionally also Nh.  A physical width of 0    is allowed, which is interpreted as a delta function (integrations of delta     function is treated appropriately, although it may look incorrect in the        differential form, which is what is saved by the OUTPUT command).                                                                                               Gaussian is primarily intended as second (etc.) component in addition to a      continuum model, with the same Nh as the primary component.  In such cases,     specify the equivalent width in eV rather than the 'relative strength'.                  0           6          10                                              Other, perhaps more complex, models can be  imported in the form of an Ascii    file containing energy  (keV)-photon flux (photons/cm/cm/s/keV) pairs.    Nh    correction is  optional  (i.e., interstellar absorption can be included when    producing the file or done within PIMMS). If the full directory/file name is    not specified, user's current default directory is assumed first, and if not    the models directory (see help item under that name) is searched.                        0           4          10                                              Some external models (see help item under that name) may be kept under the      MODELS subdirectory.   If the file names  and a short description  is also      included in the MODEL.IDX file,  then PIMMS users will be able to see what      is available.                                                                            0           7          10                                              To import a model from XSPEC, start XSPEC and read, e.g., a template ASCA       SIS pha file (which specifies the SIS response matrix which specifies the       PHA channel  boundary etc.).    Create your model.   Then use IPLOT MODEL       command to plot  the model,  then from within plot  use the WD <filename>       command to output the model into an Ascii file.  The program XSING within       the MODELS directory  should be used  to convert the  XSPEC output into a       form readable by PIMMS.                                                                  0          14           1                                              Command syntax: PLASMA apec/mekal/rs                                            Minimum abbreviation: P                                                         Example: "PLASMA MEKAL"                                                                                                                                         This command specifies the grid to use when the plasma model is specified.      The default, chosen at start-up, is APEC.  If a plasma model is currently       in use (including as a component of a compound model), the grid is switched     on the fly if at all possible.  If none is being use, this command serves       as a preliminary step for the next MODEL command that does include a plasma     component.                                                                                                                                                      Note that the mekal grid does not extend to below logT of 6.00; for the         lowest temperature plasmas, use APEC or Raymond-Smith, both of which            extend down to logT=5.6.                                                                 0          12           1                                              Command syntax: FROM <mission> [<det> [<filt>]] [<lo>-<hi>]                                  or FROM FLUX <unit> <lo>-<hi> [UNABSORBED] [ANGSTROMS]                          or FROM DENSITY <unit> <energy> [UNABSORBED] [ANGSTROMS]                        or FROM NORMALIZATION                                              Minimum abbreviation: F                                                         Examples: "FROM EINSTEIN IPC" "FROM FLUX PHOTONS 0.5-10"                                                                                                        This command specifies the default "instrument" that the conversion is to take  place from.

It then looks, for each mission (i.e., satellite), detector and  filter combination, the  appropriate calibration files for the effective area,  values used for image simulation etc.    Since this is a run-time process, the  following items may not exactly correspond to what you see.   For a listing of  what is currently available, use the DIRECTORY command.                                                                                                         For active and near-future missions, we provide the latest effective area       curves with PIMMS for proposal preparation purposes.  If the effective area     changes in-orbit, count rate to flux conversion factor for actual observations  is time-dependent, which PIMMS is currently not well equipped to handle.                 2           3         234                                            GIS                               3  263SIS                               3  266  The the Japanese X-ray satellite, ASCA, had 4 co-aligned telescopes, each       having an effective area  of ~250 cm^2 at 1 keV; there were two GIS and         two SIS detectors.                                                                       0           2         258                                              GIS was a imaging gas scintillation proportional counter.

Version 4.10 of PIMMS contains effective area curves for the proposed X-IFU     (X-ray Integral Field Unit) instrument produced in late 2018, taken from         http://x-ifu-resources.irap.omp.eu/PUBLIC/RESPONSES/CC_CONFIGURATION/          Since this is a high spectral resolution instrument, PIMMS should be used       only to judge whether a spectral simulation is worthwhile, and if so, to        provide the initial guess as to the likely exposure time needed. Note also      that PIMMS assumes 100% throughput in estimating the count rates. The actual    throughput will be less in a count-rate dependent manner.                                0           2         234                                              BBXRT was flown on the Shuttle with the ASTRO payload in December 1990.

For imaging with ACIS-S, the observer will thus         have the choice of FI/BI.  Since the FI chips have a performance identical      to that of the ACIS-I chips, only the BI chip option is separately available    in PIMMS.  See also PILEUP.                                                              0           1         289                                              High Resolution Camera covers a larger area of the sky with smaller pixels.              0          11         289                                              ACIS-S will be the normal readout instrument for HETG spectra. The curves       use the flight instrument chip layout of 4 FI and 2 BI chips. PIMMS will        provide count rates for both grating subsets (MEG and HEG) separately, or       for the combination. A single observation provides both spectra                 simultaneously in a cross-shaped orientation. Since the energy response and     spectral resolution of the two grating assemblies differ, separation of the     output may be important for some users. In all cases the output is for          isolated first order. The energy resolution of the ACIS instrument will         allow the user to separate this from the higher order light. See the Proposers  Observatory Guide for more information.  Count rate in the zeroth order         image can also be calculated (see also PILEUP).                                          0          13         289                                              HRC-S is the normal readout instrument for LETG spectra. PIMMS currently        allows determination of the count rates in the 0th order image; 1st order       spectrum; and the higher orders; through the "normal" part of the UV/Ion        shield.  NOTE in practice, due to the lack of energy resolution of the HRC,     isolation of the first order signal will require a combination of "normal"      and "low-energy reject" mode observations which are likely to take roughly      twice as long as the estimate provided by PIMMS. An alternative is to use       the High Energy Suppression Filter (HESF) which effectively isolates first      order from 0.05-0.44 keV.                                                                                                                                       LETG data can also be read out with the ACIS-S detectors; 0th and 1st order     count rates for this combination can also be estimated with PIMMS (see          also PILEUP).                                                                            0          21         289                                              Observations of bright sources with ACIS are limited by photon pileups          (see Proposers' Observatory Guide).  This version of PIMMS includes a pileup    estimate (based on the separate 'pileup' tool written at CXC).                  This feature, when turned on (by uncompressing the 'special' files in the       data directory), will provide you with an estimate of the degree of pile-       up for ACIS-I, ACIS-S, HETG-ACIS-I ORDER0, HETG-ACIS-S ORDER0, LETG-ACIS-I      ORDER0, and LETG-ACIS-S ORDER0 observations.                                                                                                                    Note that this is valid only for point source observations on-axis.                                                                                             Pile-up effect can be mitigated by placing the source off-axis --- the          inferior PSF will spread the photons over many pixels.  Quantitative            analysis of this is not yet available in PIMMS.   The other principal           method of altering the frame time can be evaluated by PIMMS.  For this          purpose, the 'go' command of PIMMS for ACIS-I and ACIS-S allows an              optional numerical parameter.  If given, it will be taken as the frame          time (allowed range: 0.2-3.3 s), and gives the pile-up fraction                 accordingly.  If absent, PIMMS will attempt to estimate the frame time          at which the pile-up fraction is 10% (which is the rule-of-thumb number         above which you will have a severe problem).  For the two 0th order             images, the default frame time of 3.2 s is assumed.                                      0           1         234                                              Currently PIMMS have IPC, HRI and MPC effective area curves.                             3           2         234                                            SW                                2  369MW                                2  371LW                                2  373                                          PIMMS currently has the effective area curves for the three channels of  the    spectrometer, which is used by GOs for pointed observations.                             0           1         364                                              Covers ~70-190A (60-180eV).                                                              0           1         364                                              Covers ~140-380A (33-90eV).                                                              0           1         364                                              Covers ~280-750A (16-44eV).                                                              3           1         234                                            LE                                2  379ME                                2  382GSPC                              4  384                                          EXOSAT is the European X-ray satellite.                                                  0           2         375                                              Only the LE1/CMA effective area data are kept within PIMMS.

The PIMMS set-up for the A4 LED instrument is meant to make it straightforward  to use the Levine et al (1984, ApJS 54, 281) catalog for XTE proposals.  As an  input, use the A+B+C combined count rate; as an output, A+B+C rate as well      as the individual rate in the four bands (A through D) are given.  One          suggested use is to specify HEAO1 A4 as both input and output instrument:       by an iterative process, the user can find a spectral model that reproduces     the distribution of counts in different bands.  Then switch to a different      output instrument (in terms of energy range, LED matches the higher end of      XTE PCA and the lower end of XTE HEXTE) keeping that model.                                                                                                     For the A1 instruments, effective area curves for two gain settings, AGCL       and AGCP. Both are normalized to produce count rates per square cm to allow     direct comparison with HEAO-1 A1 X-ray Source Catalog (Wood et al. 1984,        ApJSupp, 56, 507; also available online). The AGCP version is applicable to     the majority of sources, while the AGCL setting is appropriate for sources at   ecliptic longitudes in the 230-265 and 50-85 deg ranges (but excluding those    at ecliptic latitude >+80 or <-80). The effective area curves were digitized    from Fig. 7 of Wood et al. by Koji Mukai, while Dr. Kent Wood of NRL kindly     provided additional information.                                                         4           5         234                                            SXS                               3  420SXI                               3  432HXI                               3  437SGD                               3  443  Hitomi (formerly ASTRO-H) is the Japanese-led international X-ray observatory   with a substantial US contribution, and was launched on February 17th 2016.

We provide    four files corresponding to the current set of science filters (open, 25        micron Be, and 50 micron Be, as well as the optical blocking filter, OBF).      These files are appropriate for point sources on-axis, adding counts in all     pixels of the 6x6 array.  For the detector, a spectral resoulution of 5 eV      and the baseline set of XRS filters are assumed.  For bright sources, SXS       suffers from a photon pile-up effect: the fraction of events that can be        detected at the full resolution will decrease for higher count rate source.     The current version provides a preliminary estimate of this effect, the         accuracy of which is under investigation.                                                0           4         412                                              Soft X-ray Imager (SXI) is an CCD based instrument located at the focus of      a soft X-ray telescope (SXT-I).

Since 2010 October, two units of JEM-X are         operational, but PIMMS continues to provide count rate per one unit.

PIMMS v4.7     contains effective area curve files provided by the MAXI team in mid-2013,      normalized to produce count rates per square cm.  More information on MAXI      can be obtaeind from the MAXI home page at Riken (http://maxi.riken.jp/top/).            0          18         234                                              NICER (the Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR) is a payload on          the International Space Station for X-ray astrophysics. It achieves a           high effective area, particularly in the 1 keV band, using a set of 56          concentrators, each with a dedicated silicon drift detector.  Since NICER       is not a true imaging mission, PIMMS includes typical background rates          and estimate times for 5-sigma detection (with just statistical errors          and with an additional 10% systematic errors on the background) in the          total NICER band as well as in two pre-defined energy ranges.                                                                                                   Note that the broadband background rate reported by PIMMS v4.9/v4.9a            included background counts below 0.2 keV, where the rate is very high.          This is outside the nominal energy range of NICER and resulted in more          pessimistic estimates of the signal-to-noise than were appropriate. This        has been corrected in v4.10.                                                                                                                                    The current (v4.10) effective-area file and the typical background rates        were provided by the NICER project in 2019 August and are appropriate for       preparation of Cycle 2 proposals.                                                        0          11         234                                              NuSTAR is an X-ray satellite with 10-meter focusing length and two              side-by-side focal plane modules, each with 4 detectors.  The count rate        calculated by PIMMS reflects the total from both modules for a 50% PSF          extraction region. In Version 4.7a, the NuSTAR effective area curve file        and related mission specific information were updated to reflect post-launch    understanding, based on the response and background files for simulation        released in 2013 August; also, the upper limit of the nominal energy range      of the mission was changed from 80 keV to 79 keV.

The observations are carried out with two halves of the                         experiment alternatively pointing source and background region, providing       a continuous monitoring of the background.                                      The PSD is sensitive in the 15-300 keV energy bandwidth and has a               FOV of 1.5 deg.                                                                          0           3         516                                              The Wide field Cameras is position sensitive proportional counter               sensitive in the 2-30 keV band. There are 2 WFC on board SAX.

The current PIMMS implimentation is based on            information from the instrument teams as of 2012 September for the HXD          and 2014 December for the XIS, as collected by the Suzaku GOF                   (http://suzaku.gsfc.nasa.gov/), and is appropriate for AO-10 proposers.                                                                                         Note, however, that AO-10 proposals must not require the HXD to                 achieve its core scientific objectives, as the satellite is operated            without the HXD for the majority of time.                                                0           9         549                                              The Hard-Xray Detector is a non-imaging instrument with an effective            area of ~300 square cm featuring a compound-eye configuration and an            extremely low background.  It consists of two types of sensors, silicon         PIN diodes and GSO crystal scintillators.                                                                                                                       Starting with v3.9h, PIMMS also outputs approximate time needed for 3-sigma     and 5-sigma detections in standard energy bands (1 for PIN and 2 for GSO),      taking into account the current level of systematic uncertainties in the        background models.                                                                       0          10         549                                              There are four units of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer on-board Suzaku,         three with frontside-illuminated (FI) CCDs and one with a backside-             illuminated (BI) CCD, although XIS-2 (with an FI chip) has becom inoperative    in November, 2006.  Each XIS detector is located at the focus of a              conical foil X-Ray Telescope (XRT) with a 4.75m focal length.  The CCD          pixels of XIS vastly oversamples the XRT PSF, thereby allowing high S/N         spectroscopy with a relatively benign amount of photon pile-up.                                                                                                 PIMMS currently returns count rate per one unit of XIS, with no further         instrument specific information.                                                         0           2         549                                              The X-Ray Spectrometer lost all its liquid helium cryogen and is no longer      usable.                                                                                  0          20         234                                              Swift (see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html) is             a multiwavlength gamma-ray burst observatory launched on 2004 November 20.      Swift carries a wide-field (2 sr), coded-aperture Burst Alert Telescope         (BAT, 15-150 keV); an X-Ray Telescope (XRT, 0.2-10 keV); and a UV/Optical       Telescope (UVOT, 170-650 nm).  The effective area curves for XRT now            reflects the 2008 July CALDB release, for photon counting and window timing     modes.  The photodiode mode (no longer operative) is also included              using an older calibration.  Of the UVOT (9 filters, including "white"          for unfiltered and 2 grisms) effective areas, those for the 2 grisms            are pre-launch estimates, and others (in PIMMS 3.9f) are derived from           the 2007 May CALDB release.  The BAT response in PIMMS v3.6c and later          yields the counts per fully illuminated detector, which matches the BAT         analysis software default units.  One detector has a geometric area of          0.16 cm^2.  An on-axis source illuminates 16384 detectors; PIMMS v3.6b          and earlier calculated the total on-axis count rates (i.e., per 16384           detectors).                                                                                                                                                     Note that PIMMS is primarily an X-ray tool, and extrapolation to the            UV regime introduces additional uncertainties.  In particular, PIMMS            assumes E(b-v) = Nh / 4.8e+21 and an average Milkyway extinction law.                    0          34         234                                              XMM-Newton (implemented using the pre-launch name, XMM, in PIMMS) was launched  successfully in 1999 December.  It consists of three coaligned                  high-throughput 7.5m focal length telescopes with six arc second (FWHM)         angular resolution.  The European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC), which           consists of two MOS and one PN CCD arrays, provide moderate spectral            resolution over a30 arc minute field of view.  High-resolution                  spectral information (E/dE~300) is provided by the Reflection Grating           Spectrometer (RGS) that deflects half of the beam on two of the X-ray           telescopes (those with the MOS arrays).  The observatory also has a             coaligned 30cm optical/UV telescope called the Optical Monitor (OM).            See http://astro.estec.esa.nl/XMM/xmm.html for further details.                                                                                                 The count rates for the EPIC MOS are given for one instrument each (we have     averaged of MOS1 and MOS2 effective area curves), not for pairs of instruments  Starting with PIMMS v4.1, the EPIC count rates are given for PATTERN=0-12       (for MOS)/PATTERN=0-4 (pn) events over a large (5 arcmin) extraction region.    This reverses the practice adoptied in v3.6 to use a 15 arcse radius            extraction region, and that adopted in v3.9c to report only the PATTERN=0       count rates for PN.                                                                                                                                             For the RGS, count rates for RGS1 and RGS2 in two orders can be                 calculated separately (i.e., a total of 4 possible combinations).               Even though the term 'filter' is used (because that's what the most             common use of the third level of instrument specification in PIMMS),            these do not represent physical filters.  Data are taken in all three           orders simultaneously, to be extracted into separate spectra using              software filters.                                                                                                                                               For the OM, we provide effective area curves derived from the version 2.0       response files provided at the ESA site                                         (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/om-response-files).                                                                                                  This version of PIMMS contains effective area curves appropriate for            AO-19 proposals.                                                                         3           4         234                                            PCA                               3  648HEXTE                             5  661ASM                               3  679                                          Although the official name of this mission is Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer,      the mission name within pimms remains 'XTE'.  See                               	http://xte.gsfc.nasa.gov/                                                      for details of the mission.                                                              0          12         641                                              The Proportional Counter Array is a mechanically-collimated array of five       xenon proportional counters with a total effective area of ~7000 cm^2;          however, different observations are taken with difeerent numbers of PCUs on.    Therefore, starting with PIMMS v2.7, user must supply the count rate per PCU    when this is used as the input mission (from xte pca).  When used as the        output mission (inst xte pca), the first output is count rate per PCU summed    over all energies and over all 3 xenon layers.  Additional outputs (the rates   in the 6 canonical PCA channels required on the proposal form and used in       RECOMMD) are given for 3 and 2 PCU combinations, which are becoming more        frequent (the proposal form requires the 3 PCU numbers).  The effective area    curves, channel boundaries and the extimated background rates are all           appropriate for Epoch 4 gain setting.                                                    0          17         641                                              The High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment consists of two clusters of             detectors, with 4 scintillation detectors in each cluster.  Source and          background count rates are given per cluster.  Values are given for the         total count rate, and the count rates in the 4 canonical HEXTE channels         required on the proposal form and used in HEXTEmporize.                                                                                                         A 'filter' name is now (starting with v2.3) required for HEXTE in PIMMS,        to choose the LLD (Lower Level Discriminator) value.  The filter names          are DEFAULT (D; LLD=12), LLD10, LLD15, LLD20, LLD25, or LLD30.                                                                                                  The quoted detection times assume two-cluster 16-s source/background            beamswitching, i.e., one cluster measures background while the other is         on-source.  In this case, the "detection time" applies to the combined          HEXTE instrument.  For those bright source observations (source rate >>         background rate) where a HEXTE cluster is selected to be in STARE mode,         this detection time can also be interpreted as appropriate for a single         HEXTE cluster.  For the combined HEXTE detection time, divide by sqrt(2).                0           1         641                                              On-axis effective area for a single SSC of the All Sky Monitor is included.              0           8         234                                              New in PIMMS v3.3: it can now convert to/from flux density at a specific        energy, rather than integrated flux over a range of energies ("flux").          To use density, the unit must be specified: "ERGS" for ergs/cm/cm/s/keV         or "PHOTONS" for photons/cm/cm/s/keV.  Also necessary is the energy of          interest (in keV).  Alternatively, this can be specified as the wavelength      in Angstroms, with the optional argument "Angstrom, in which case flux          density is in (photons or ergs)/cm/cm/s/Angstrom.  Flux density can be          "unabsorbed" as is flux.                                                                 0          10         234                                              PIMMS can also calculate conversion to/from flux values not folded through      any instrument responses can also be used.  To use flux, the unit must be       specified: "ERGS" for ergs/cm/cm/s or "PHOTONS" for photons/cm/cm/s.  Also      necessary is the energy range of interest, to be specified in the form          "2.5-10" (for 2.5 to 10 keV), or the wavelength range of interest, to be        specified with a range plus the optional letter A ("1-50 A" --- note the        space in between).  Optional keyword "UNABSORBED" following the range will      make PIMMS calculate flux with Nh set to 0.0; this is useful in relating        the flux to the total bolometric luminosity of the X-ray source before          interstellar absorption.                                                                 0           5         234                                              PIMMS now supports the use of 'model normalization'.  This is most useful       for modelx imported from xspec, in which case a normalization of 1.0 is         the flux level as simulated within xspec.  The use of normalization is not      recommended for models bulit-in to PIMMS, as they do not necessarily relate     to any physical quantities.                                                              0          13           1                                              Commands can be  abbreviated  (as long  as it is  unique),  and numerical  and  character  string  parameters can  be passed onto  the commands.    Parameters  are  interpreted  according   to  their  positions  within  the  command  line  (first string is input file name,  second file name is  output file name etc.,  although this does  not happen in PIMMS).   Some parameters  are compulsory  -  PIMMS  will prompt  you  for  them if they are not given on the  command line;  others are optional  (default values will  be used unless  the user  specifies  them  on the  command  line).   Commands can  be stringed  together by using a  semicolon.

HELP items are arranged in  many levels, so that you start with a general introduction and pick up as many  specific details as you like by going down several levels.                               0           2         721                                              If the string supplied by the user  can be matched to (parts of) two more more  topic names, then information on all the matching topics will be displayed.              0           2         721                                              Type  the EOF character  (^Z on VMS and ^D on UNIX machines)  to exit from      this help immediately.                                                                   0           1         721                                              Type <RETURN> as the topic name to go up one level.                                      0           1         721                                              Type "?" to repeat the current level.                                                    0           4         721                                              This help is case-insensitive  (i.e., it accepts both lower-case and capital    letters).

Version 4.10 includes an update for NICER, suitable for Cycle 2 proposers.      The changes in the effective area curve are minor; far more important is        the updates in the broadband (now clearly defined as 0.2-12 keV) background     count rate; background rate in Version 4.9/4.9a was much higher, since it       included contributions below 0.2 keV.

Version 4.8e contains an updated set of effective area curves for the           EPIC instruments on XMM-Newton, suitable for AO-17 proposals. However,          differences with the AO-16 versions are minimal.

Version 4.7a contains an updated effective area curve and associated            information for NuSTAR, reflecting the post-launch understanding of the         mission.  Although documentations for version 4.7 (released 2014 March 5)       claimed this update was made in that version, this was regrettably not          the case due to a configruation management error. In version 4.7a, the          new effective area curve is includedn and the upper limit of the instrument     energy range was updated from 80 keV to 79 keV.                                                                                                                 Version 4.7 newly includes effective area curves for MAXI SSC and GSC           all-sky monitor instruments. It also newly includes support for the HEAO-1      A1 instrument, appropriate for a direct comparison with the HEAO-1 A1 X-ray     Source Catalog. It also contains updated effective area curves for the Chandra  instruments, appropriate for Cycle 16 proposals.  Differences with Cycle 15     versions are minor.

Version 4.2 includes a new set of Suzaku effective area curves, suitable        for Cycle 6 proposers, and an accompanying update in the code to estimate       detection limits for the HXD detectors.  Also, references to count rates        for point sources observed at the HXD nominal position have been removed,       as this pointing position is no longer recommended.                                      0          15         754                                              Version 4.1b includes an updated effective area curves for XMM (suitable        for AO-10 proposals) and for IXO, and an updated version of pms_slmdl.f         which conforms strictly to the Fortran standard.

In reality,      for the MOS, PATTERNS 0-12 rate is used in both versions 4.1 and 4.1a.                                                                                          * By the request of XMM-Newton project at ESA, version 4.1 reverts                to using a large extraction region and PATTERNS 0 through 12 (MOS)/4 (pn)       in calculating EPIC count rates.                                              * Version 4.1 includes preliminary effective area curves for ASTRO-H,             the Japanese-US mission scheduled for launch in 2014.                         * Version 4.1 now reports energy/wavelength ranges with an increased              number of digits.                                                                      0          22         754                                              As of version 4.0, two new grids of models for collisionally excited thermal    plasma (using mekal and APEC codes) are available.  The expanded grid of        Raymond-Smith plasma model that was available as an add-on to the previous      distributions are now standard; the more limited grid that was the standard     in V3.9k and earlier versions has now been retired.  Of the three grids,        APEC is now the default.  To swith among the plasma models, version 4.0         introduce a new command, "PLASMA."  The syntax of the "MODEL" command           has accordingly changed.  The old model name, "raymond-smith" (or RS) is        no longer recognized, to be replaced with "PLASMA".  The model component,       plasma, requires 3 numerical parameters: temperature, abuandance, and Nh,       in that order.  An optional string parameter to be placed after the             temperature can be used to switch the units of temperature from keV             (default) to logT.                                                                                                                                              Log files now contain command echos.                                                                                                                            As of Version 4.0, the effective area curves for missions Constellation-X,      XEUS, and Spectrum X-Gamma have been removed from PIMMS.  Those for the         International X-ray Observatory (IXO) have been added.                                                                                                          Version 4.0 includes updated effective area curves for the Chandra              instruments, suitable for Cycle 12 proposers.                                            0          55         754                                              Version 3.9k incorporates an updated set of Suzaku effective area curves,       as well as HXD background numbers, appropriate for Cycle 5 proposers.                                                                                           Version 3.9j incorporates a new set of Chandra effective area cureves,          recommended for use by those writing Cycle 11 proposals.                                                                                                        Version 3.9i correctly treats the statistical errors in the Suzaku HXD          background files provided to the users.  Previous versions would have           underestimated the necessary exposure times somewhat.  It also corrects         bugs for Swift XRT grade 0 count rates as well as ASCA count rates within       the typical extraction regions, in cases when a limited energy range is         spacified.  Also updated is the message regarding the instrument-specific       extra information (or the lack thereof) when a limited energy range is          specified.                                                                                                                                                      Version 3.9h includes minor updates to the effective area curves for            Suzaku XIS and HXD instruments.  In addition, PIMMS now outputs                 approximate time needed for 3-sigma and 5-sigma detection in standard           HXD energy bands (1 for PIN and 2 for GSO), given the current level             of systematic uncertainties in the background models.                                                                                                           Version 3.9g includes updated effective area curves for XMM-Newton EPIC         MOS cameras, with an added warning from the team regarding MOS1 timing          mode data.  It also includes updated effective area curves for Swift            XRT.                                                                                                                                                            Version 3.9f includes up-to-date effective area curves for INTEGRAL             ISGRI and JEM-X instruments.                                                                                                                                    Version 3.9f includes updated effective area curves for Constellation-X         instruments (under the revised mission name, 'conx'), XEUS, and for Swift       UVOT (except grisms).                                                                                                                                           Version 3.9e includes updated effective area curves for Chandra instruments     for Cycle 10 proposers.                                                                                                                                         Version 3.9d includes updated effective area curves for Suzaku XIS & HXD        for Cycle 3 propoers.                                                                                                                                           Version 3.9c includes updated effective area curves for XMM-Newton EPIC         instruments, including a change for pn to PATTERN=0 events only.  Pile-up       calculation had to be adjusted to still use total count rates.                                                                                                  Version 3.9b includes a bug fix for energy flux calculations using redshifted   table-based models (including Raymond-smith).  Effective area curves for        Chandra instruments have been updated for Cycle 9 proposers in Version 3.9b.                                                                                    Effective area curves for Suzaku XIS and HXD have been updated for              Cycle 2 proposers in version 3.9a.                                                                                                                              Effective area curves for XMM-Newton EPIC instruments have been updated         for AO-6 proposers.                                                                                                                                             One bug, which caused crashes for the command-line version on Linux             platforms, has been fixed in this version.                                               0           9         754                                              Effective area curves for Swift/XRT Photon Counting and Windowed Timing modes   have been updated in version 3.8a.                                                                                                                              Previous versions used an old and incorrect deadtime fraction for burst         mode for XMM-Newton EPIC-pn detector.  This has been corrected in V3.8.                                                                                         With this version, PIMMS now calculates Swift/BAT count rates in 4 standard     survey bands, and also includes the background count rates and hence the        exposure time necessary to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 5.0.                         0          19         754                                                                                                                              V3.7a includes Suzaku-specific updates.                                                                                                                         This version now provides assumptions regarding the input count rate            (such as extraction region for imaging instruments) for various missions.                                                                                       This version includes the AO-5 versions of XMM-Newton EPIC effective area       curves, which differs slightly from the AO-4 versions.  There are no updates    for the RGS effective area.                                                                                                                                     This version also includes calibration updates of the RXTE PCA effective        area curves.  The count rate should increase by about 11% compared to           previous versions.  This is deemed minor enough that no impact is expected      in proposals and in observation planning.                                                                                                                       PIMMS now uses the post-launch name, Suzaku, for the former Astro-E2.                                                                                           This version also includes post-launch calibration of the Swift XRT,            in three data modes (photon counting, photodiode, and windowed timing).                  0          16         754                                              V3.6 has the new Swift BAT effective area curve for one detector,               to match the default units used in BAT analysis software.  In comparison,       previous versions (v3.6b and earlier) used the effective area for 16384         detectors (the total number fully illuminated by an on-axis source).
