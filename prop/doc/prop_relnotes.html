<h3><a name="rel_R3A12.4">Release R3A12.4</a></h3>
<h4><i>Alpha Test of GO version residing on **TBD**; released for review on **TBD** </i></h4>
Upgrades provided in Release R3A12.4 are summarized below for each application.
<h4>OVERALL TOOLKIT</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Toolkit GUI was redesigned and placed in a separate, resizable
frame launched from the Toolkit Web Page. This allows users to resize
the application to account for the different font styles and sizes
found on different machines.
 <li>A Toolkit Control Panel was added to the Toolkit Web Page. The
Control Panel can launch a Toolkit window as a separate process or
thread from the Web browser window. This improves run time
efficiency and also allows users to view other Web pages while
using the toolkit. When not in use, the user can quit 
the Toolkit window to minimize CPU load on their machine. A 
new Toolkit can be launched by returning to the Toolkit Web Page
and selecting "Start New Toolkit" on the Control Panel. The Control
Panel will only allow one Toolkit window at a time.
 <li>A status bar on each tool provides the user with status while the tool
is communicating with the server.
 <li>added additional text directing user to other documents
 <li>made all help files available from top of Toolkit (top of Java Applet 
 Window frame)
 <li>changed references from "Science Instrument Notebook" to "Observatory 
     Guide"
</ul>
<h4>COLDEN GUI & ALGORITHM</h4>
<ul>
 <li>upgraded to new version of Colden algorithm, which has been alpha tested
     on a PC w/LINUX for increased portability
 <li>now provides choice of Bell (Stark et al.) velocity-resolved data 
     covering northern sky to 40 degrees south, or NRAO (Dickey & Lockman) 
     data, not velocity-resolved, giving all-sky coverage
 <li>now uses FITS data files, clearing the way for increased portability
</ul>
<h4>PIMMS GUI</h4>
<ul>
 <li>for Raymond-Smith model, added display of actual "kT" value used (gridded 
value nearest to requested value is used)
</ul>
<h4>PIMMS ALGORITHM</h4>
<ul>
 <li>officially incorporated revised effective area curve for acis-i
 <li>upgraded to PIMMS v2.4; includes fix to problem preventing long 
     path/file names, clearing the way for simplifying data directory 
     organization
</ul>
