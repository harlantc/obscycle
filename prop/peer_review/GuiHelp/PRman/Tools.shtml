	      <h3>Assign Groups</h3>
	      <p>This tool allows panels to group proposals according to their definitions.  To assign proposals to groups, one first creates the groups and then assigns an existing group to a proposal.  The page is broken into five sections.  Each section is explained below.</p>

		<dt class="level1">What is a View?</dt>
		<dd>A view is a way to organize subsets of the panel data in ways that make sense to the user.  The best way to approach building a view is to organize into sections the data you wish to display. The <span class="menu_item">Build View</span> tool organizes data in the following ways:
		  <ul>
		    <li class="normal">several pieces of proposal data displayed like a list in a single column</li>
		    <li class="normal">proposal data presented in individual columns</li>
		    <li class="normal">proposal data presented in approved/requested pairs</li>
		    <li class="normal">proposal data presented in
	Cycle triplets (Cycle N/N+1/N+2)</li>
		    <li class="normal">target data</li>
		    <li class="normal">title and/or abstract</li>
		    <li class="normal">individual grades</li>
		    <li class="normal">running totals</li>
		  </ul>
		</dd>
		<dd>You can have as many sections in a view as you want and you can have as many of each type of section as you want. The view will always be built with the <span class="column">proposal number/PI</span> in the first two columns of the view. Beyond that, you decide what goes in.<img src="images/build_view.png" /></dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Load Existing View</span></dt>
		<dd>You can load an existing view into the <span class="menu_item">Build View</span> tool as a starting point for a new view.  A requestor will list the views available for loading.  After selecting a view, click <span class="button">Load</span> to load the view into the builder.  Once loaded you can edit the view in any way you wish including adding/deleting sections or columns.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Clear View</span></dt>
		<dd>You can clear the current view which is being built.  There is no prompting to see if you really want to clear the view.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Add Section</span></dt>
		<dd>In order to put data into the view, you must create a section to put the data into.  The columns in the title, abstract and grade type sections are pre-defined, so selecting the section selects the columns within the section.  After creating a proposal, target or running total section, you must add columns to it.</dd>
		<dd>When a section is added to the view, it will appear in two places in the builder:
		  <ul>
		    <li class="normal">A table listing a section id, the section name, the type of section, and the columns within the section.  For sections which can be edited, the <span class="column">Id</span> column contains a button, which when clicked will bring up a tool for editing the section.</li>
		    <li class="normal">A table listing the sections that will appear in the view.  This is where you can hide sections if you decide you really don't want it and where you can reorder the sections.  The numbers refer to the id in the table above.</li>
		  </ul>
		</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Convert Section</span></dt>
		<dd>You can convert proposal spreadsheet sections to lists and proposal list sections to spreadsheets.  Choose the section you wish to convert and click <span class="button">OK</span>.</dd>
		<dt class="level1">Edit a Section</dt>
		<dd>To edit a section, click the <span class="button">Id#</span> button to bring up a section editor.  There are three pieces of information that you can edit: 
		  <ul>
		    <li class="normal">the section name</li>
		    <li class="normal">which columns to show in a section</li>
		    <li class="normal">the order of columns in the section</li>
		  </ul>
                  <img src="images/build_view_edit_col.png" /><br />
		  To edit the columns, click on the <span class="button">Edit</span> button.  This will bring up a tool for selecting, deleting, and rearranging columns within the section.  Click <span class="button">OK</span> when you have finished with the columns.  You will then see your selection of columns in the edit window.  Clicking on <span class="button">Save</span> will record your column choices in the section definition table.</dd>
		<dt class="level1">Finalize Your Section List</dt>
		<dd>Clicking the <span class="button">Edit</span> button at the bottom of the panel containing the <span class="column">Final Section List</span> will bring up an editor similar to the column editor which will allow you to rearrange, hide, or show sections that you have created.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Preview</span></dt>
		<dd>You can preview your new view before saving it.  The view will appear in the main window of the GUI.  If you are unhappy with the view, you can go back to the tool and edit it.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Save</span></dt>
		<dd>You will be prompted to name the view before saving it.  If you give a name which is already in use, you will be prompted to supply another name.  When a view has been saved, it will be added to the <span class="menu_item">View</span>menu.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Close</span></dt>
		<dd>You will be prompted to save if you try to close with an unsaved view in the tool.</dd>

	    <div id="build_sort">
	      <h3>Build Sort</h3>
	      <p>While the GUI comes loaded with simple sorts on columns, you may find it necessary to create nested and/or grouped sorts.</p>
              <p><img src="images/build_sort.png" /></p>
	      <dl>
		<dt class="level1">Nested Sorts:</dt>
		<dd>A nested sort is a sort on more than one column.  Click the <span class="button">Edit</span> button to select and order columns for your sort.  The sorting order is done the in order that the columns are specified.  You can have as many columns deep as you want.  When applying a sort to a view, all columns in the sort must be in the view.</dd>
		<dt class="level1">Grouped Sorts:</dt>
		<dd>A grouped sort is a sort where the data is first grouped according to the group column and sorted within the group by the sort columns.  It is possible to have a group without specifying a sort column.  In such a case, the sort within the groups is done on proposal number.  If you have selected a group and then decide you don't want it, click on <span class="button">No Group</span>.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Preview</span></dt>
		<dd>You can preview your sort before saving.  You must have a view showing in main window of the GUI to preview the sort.  If you are unhappy with the sort, you can go back to the tool and edit it.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Save</span></dt>
		<dd>When you save a sort, the name will be generated by the tool.  It will be composed of the columns in sort with an indication if there is a group included.  Simple nested sorts will appear in the <span class="menu_item">Sort</span> menu.  Grouped sorts will appear in the <span class="menu_item">Grouped Sorts</span> menu.</dd>
		<dt><span class="button">Close</span></dt>
