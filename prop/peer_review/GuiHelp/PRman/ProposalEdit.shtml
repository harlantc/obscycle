	  <h2 id="section_heading">Proposal Edit Notebook</h2>
	  <p>When you click on a <span class="button">Proposal #</span> button in the main window, the proposal will be added to a notebook.  The notebook will have a tab for each proposal in the notebook and you can get to a particular proposal by clicking on the tab.  You record the panel's decisions regarding a proposal in this notebook.</p>
	  <p>A notebook page is split into two columns.  The left-hand column contains group information, proposal related fields, joint observation requests and the title/abstract. The right-hand column contains target information, grades, some status flags and a comment section.  At the bottom of the page you will find buttons to save, close, or reset the page.</p>
          <p><img src="images/edit_page.png"/></p>
	  <p>All changed values will be checked for format and to make sure the value is in the proper range.  An error message will appear if you have entered an inappropriate value.  On occasion a panel will want to edit a value which is not editable in the GUI.  In such cases, you should contact CDO to consult with the panel chair.</p>
	  <p><em>All proposals must be graded</em>, unless they are deemed <em>infeasible</em>.  LP/VLP proposals are graded only, the panel cannot edit any values in the proposal.  When a proposal requesting observing time has been turned-off, the proposal is no longer editable and a note to this effect appears on the notebook page.</p>
	  <dl>
	    <dt class="level1">Group Id</dt>
	    <dd>You can move a proposal to another existing group by selecting a new group from the list.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Proposal Information</dt>
	    <dd>This section gives information like the PI, total time requested, calculated totals, etc.  Generally, none of these fields can be edited.  The one exception is the status for archive and theory proposals.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Joint Observations</dt>
	    <dd>If a proposal is requesting joint time, the request will be displayed here.  If a panel reduces the time of the proposal in any way, they should (but are not required to) reduce the joint time as well.  You will be prompted on <span class="button">Save</span> as a reminder if this happens.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Abstract</dt>
	    <dd>The title and abstract are displayed for completeness</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Target Information</dt>
	    <dd>A number of columns for each target are displayed in one or more tables depending on the type of targets in the column.  Several of those fields will be editable by the panel.  Changes in this table will then be reflected in totals under the Proposal Information section after you <span class="button">Save</span> the changes.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Grades</dt>
	    <dd>You record the panel's grades here.  On <span class="button">Save</span>, the average and median grades as well as the standard deviation and normalized grade will be computed.  Sometimes a panel may wish to grade a proposal twice, assuming different target configurations.  In that case, enter the first set of grades, record the results in the Comments section, enter the second set of grades and report the results.  Enter the set which panel wishes to keep in the grades section and record the other results in the Comments.
	    <p>If the panel decides they do not want to discuss a proposal which they did not triage at the beginning of the review and do not wish to go back and triage it, then enter the preliminary grades as the final grades and make a comment to that effect.  This is often done with low scoring LP/VLP proposals.</p></dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Grade Comment</dt>
	    <dd>If you record two sets of grades, this field should be
	used to indicate the circumstances under which the currently visible
	grades were recorded.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Infeasible Proposal</dt>
	    <dd>On occasion and proposal is considered to be infeasible.  This could be for science reasons or because the proposal was incomplete.  Setting this flag will turn the proposal off, count it as graded, and ignore it in the normalized grade calculations.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Comments</dt>
	    <dd>This space if where you give any detailed notes which the panel wishes to convey regarding this proposal.</dd>
	    <dt class="level1">Buttons</dt>
		<ul>
		  <li class="level2"><span class="button">Save</span> saves all changes in the window.</li>
		  <li class="level2"><span class="button">Close</span> closes the proposal page if there are no <em>unsaved</em> changes.  A proposal with <em>unsaved</em> changes will have an asterisk in the tab.</li>
		  <li class="level2"><span class="button">Reset</span>
	Resets all values to the last <em>saved</em> values.</li>
			  <li class="level2"><span
	class="button">Other Grades</span> Toggles between two
	possible sets of grades and their associated Grade Comments.</li>
