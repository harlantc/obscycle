	  <p>In this section you will find information associated with GUI.  Things like searching for information within a view and column definitions are described here.</p>

	    <!-- Searching Within a View -->
	    <div id="search_view">
	      <h3>Searching Within a View</h3>
	      <p>Most views contain a <strong>Search for</strong> widget which will find the first occurrence of a string in the column selected and scroll to that position in the table.  If no match is found, a warning is given.  Because of some finicky behavior with the table widget being used in the GUI, you may have to click on the bottom left scrollbar arrow a few times to make your proposal appear or on the right top scrollbar arrow to make you column appear or resize the table.  As long as you did not get a warning, the string should be there.</p>
	    </div>
	    <!-- Status Page -->
	    <div id="status_page">
	      <h3>Status Page</h3>
	      <p>When you start the GUI a status page for the panel is displayed.  This page records running tallies of edits performed with the GUI.  Tallies are red if a balance is overdrawn.  You cannot close this window except by quitting the GUI.</p>
	      <dl>
		<dt><span class="button">Print</span></dt>
		<dd>Allows you to print the current status of the panel.</dd>
		<dt class="level1"><em>Note:</em></dt>
		<dd>Sometimes the tally does not switch to <span class="blue">blue</span> when the balance goes positive.  The sign on the number is correct though.</dd>
	      </dl>
	    </div>
	    <!-- Editing Proposals -->
	    <div id="edit_prop">
	      <h3>Editing Proposals</h3>
	      <p>The majority of your interactions will be in editing the proposals according to the Panel's wishes.  To edit a proposal, you click on the proposal number in the view.  This will bring up a notebook with each selected proposal as a tabbed page in the notebook.  There are actually very few fields that a panel can edit, and not every proposal contains all of those fields.  If a field can be edited, it will be apparent on the <strong>Edit Page</strong> for the proposal.</p>
	      <p>You can tab between fields on an edit page (shift-tab goes in reverse).  When a change has been made to a field, the tab label is marked with an asterisk when the focus leaves the field being edited.  You cannot close a page without dealing with unsaved changes.  Closing a page removes it from the notebook.  Reset sets all values to their last saved values.</p>
	      <p>If there are fields that the panel would like to change, but the <strong>Edit Page</strong> does not allow it, you can put their request in the comments section or contact CDO if that is not sufficient for the panel chair.</p>
	      <dl>
                 <dt class="level1">Reverse TOO</dt>
                <dd>Some proposals have been designated as reverse TOOs.  This designation is assigned by CDO.  Such proposals are docked as one TOO trigger based on the target's rev_too value.</dd>
