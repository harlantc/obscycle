Building a Customized Processing Status Table
</div>
</div>

<p>The Processing Status Tool enables users to create customized reports
on the processing status of Chandra observations.
<p>The physical format of the reports may be regular HTML, tab-delimited
ASCII, or RDB.
<p>The content format of the reports may be chosen from a set of standard
reports or may be arbitrarily customized.&nbsp; For a description of all
status fields and information on what is included in the standard reports,
see&nbsp; <a href="op_olist.html">Chandra Observations Processing Status Fields
</a>page.
<p>Where appropriate, links are made to V&amp;V reports if they exist.&nbsp;
<p>The observations to be included in the reports may be selected by specifying
Selection Criteria for up to nine particular fields. The default for all
selection criteria is "all selected".
<p>"Order By" allows the user to order (sort) observations in the report
by particular fields.&nbsp; One can use up to 3 ordering criteria.&nbsp;
Default is&nbsp; ("Obs Date", "None", "None").
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To build your custom report:
<p>- Select physical report format.&nbsp; The default is HTML; select tab-delimited
or RDB if desired.
<p>- If you wish to place some or all of the columns in the output table
in a particular order, select "Column numbers" for the columns you wish
to arrange.&nbsp; Any columns for which column numbers are not specified
will be placed in the output table automatically. (If you specify the same
column number for more than one field, all of the columns will be arranged
automatically.)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>- Select the field name check boxes for the fields (columns) you want
to view in the output table. Only the selected fields will appear in the
output table.&nbsp; For an explanation of the fields, see <a href="op_olist.html">Chandra
Observations Processing Status Fields.</a>
<p>- If you wish to view a particular subset of observations, specify Selection
Criteria for the appropriate fields. The default for all selection criteria
is "all selected."
