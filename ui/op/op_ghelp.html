Chandra Observations Processing Status Reports
</div>
</div>


<p>The Processing Status Tool enables users to create customized reports
on the processing status of Chandra observations.
<p>The physical format of the reports may be regular HTML, tab-delimited
ASCII, or RDB.
<p>The content format of the reports may be chosen from a set of standard
reports or may be arbitrarily customized.&nbsp; For a description of all
status fields and information on what is included in the standard reports,
see the&nbsp; <a href="op_olist.html">Chandra Observations Processing Status
Fields</a> page.
<p>Where appropriate, links are made to V&amp;V reports if they exist.
<p>The observations to be included in the reports may be selected by specifying
Selection Criteria for up to nine particular fields. The default for all
selection criteria is "all selected".
<p>"Order By" allows the user to order (sort) observations in the report
by particular fields.&nbsp; One can use up to 3 ordering criteria.&nbsp;
Default is&nbsp; ("Obs Date", "None", "None").
