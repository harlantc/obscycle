<P>CPS is used by all Chandra groups as the input to the observation
database, so the <b>Proposal Type</b> is important.  General
Observers (GOs) should choose one of the <i>GO</i>, <i>TOO</i>, 
<i>LP</i>(GO and Large Project), <i>VLP</i>(GO and Very Large Project),
TOO/LP(TOO and Large Project),<i>Theory</i> or <i>Archive</i> types as appropriate.
<p>The CXC expects to award ~6 Msec of observing time to the Big Project Panel as described in the  <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/">Call for Proposals</a>.

<p> The <i>Proposal Type</i> of CAL is only to be used by CXC.
No proposal from non-CXC personnel can be accepted that requests
a Calibration observation.  
The <i>Proposal Type</i> of GTO is only to be used by members of a GTO team 
when submitting proposals using the time allocated to the GTO team.

<li class="elehelp"><a name="ArchiveBudget" class="lblhelp"> If archive/theory request, enter proposed budget</a>
<br>
If this is an archive or theory request, please enter the total amount of the
proposed budget. Units =  $1000 (U.S. dollars).

<br>

<I>Required</I>.

<li class="elehelp"><a name="Multicycle" class="lblhelp"> Is this a multi-cycle observing proposal?</a>
<br>
When scientifically well-justified, Chandra observing time  
for a target may be proposed to span up to 3 cycles.  Only targets
proposed in the current cycle may have observations extending into
future cycles.  Please refer to the information on Multi-Cycle
Observing Proposals in the Chandra Call for Proposals and/or on the
Proposer page: <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer"> 
http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer</a>.  

<p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-cycle proposals must request time for the current Cycle. 
<li>TOO triggers cannot be proposed here for future cycles, though TOO
followups may extend into future cycles. 
<li>Multi-cycle proposals requesting joint time may be allocated up to 
10% of cycleN+1 and  5% of cycleN+2 of the available joint time 
if scientifically justified (subject to the continued availability 
of that joint time).  If proposing joint time for future cycles, include
the total joint observing time request across all cycles.
<li>Archive/Theory proposals cannot be
multi-cycle.  However, archival proposals can be linked with a
multi-cycle observing proposal.
</ul>

<p>

If multi-cycle observations are requested for a given target, the
proposer must specify the observing constraints that require 
the observations to extend into future cycles.  Constraints
must be well-justified scientifically.  The PI must estimate
based on these constraints the amount of time required in the subsequent cycles
for each such target, assuming the earliest feasible start date for
the first target observations.  

<p>
For accounting purposes, the cycles are defined as 01 January through 31 December, where the first available Cycle begins the January after the proposal is approved.
<!--
<pre>
Cycle 21 from 01-Jan-2020 00:00 through 31-Dec-2020 23:59
Cycle 22 from 01-Jan-2021 00:00 through 31-Dec-2021 23:59
Cycle 23 from 01-Jan-2022 00:00 through 31-Dec-2022 23:59
</pre>
-->
<p>
The total observing time indicated for each cycle 
will be tallied by CPS from the individual Target Pages.
Total time requested for any proposal will be
directly forwarded to the peer review, and (at least 90%) completed if
the program is approved in its entirety. 
The estimates of the allotment of exposure time between this
and future cycles are for accounting purposes only and will be specified 
in the ObsCat accordingly. Note that, as for all observations, 
scheduling considerations may result in actual observation dates outside 
of the cycle date ranges specified above.
<p>
The proprietary period for data from multi-cycle targets
begins when 90% of the data for any given target (as allocated to each
cycle) has been made available to the observer.
<p>

<i>Required.</i> Default is No.


<li class="elehelp"><a name="Linked" class="lblhelp"> Is this proposal linked to another in this cycle ?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating that this proposal is linked to another
proposal submitted for the current Call for Proposals. 
Two proposals in the same cycle which represent separate pieces of the same science project will be reviewed by the same panel if linked (e.g. archive/observing proposals to complete a sample).

<li class="elehelp"><a name="Linked2" class="lblhelp"> If known, please enter the proposal number of the linked proposal</a>
<br>
If this proposal is linked with another proposal, please
enter the proposal number assigned to the linked proposal. If unknown,
leave blank.
