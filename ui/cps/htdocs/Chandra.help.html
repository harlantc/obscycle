  <div class="propheadercenter">Chandra Proposal Submission Help
  </div>
</div>


<p>CPS provides a facility for composing and submitting Chandra Proposals.
Electronic submission of forms and scientific justification is required.  

<fieldset class="fshelp" id="homepage"><legend>Home</legend>

The Home page displays a table of proposals owned by or shared with the current user.  A gray background on a table row means the proposal is not editable but can be viewed.  They may be proposals you have withdrawn or submitted, are from previous cycles, or are proposals that someone else owns where you are listed as the Principal Investigator(PI) or as a Co-Investigator(CoI).

The "Own?" column indicates whether or not you are the person responsible for the proposal.
These are proposals that you are actively working on, or are proposals that you have submitted
or withdrawn.
You can only edit those proposals that you both own and that are in an editable state (e.g. not
withdrawn, not from a previous cycle).

<p >
Buttons on the Home Page:
<ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="propcreate">New Proposal/Clone Proposal</a>

<br> You may create a new 'empty' proposal or clone an existing proposal.
<p>
<ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="CloneProposal">Clone Proposal?</a>
<br>Specify the proposal number you wish to clone.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Who">Who are you</a>
<br>
This field is used to auto-fill in your account profile information as either the
P.I. or as a Co-Investigator.  Other should be used if you are submitting this
proposal for someone else and are neither a P.I. nor Co-Investigator.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="CreateSubj">Subject Category</a>
<br>
This field is used to help seed the proposal number which consists of the cycle , a subject category code and a tag number.  See <a href="#SubjectCategory">Subject Category</a>.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="CreateType">Proposal Type</a>
<br>
Specify the type of proposal you are creating.  For an Observing proposal that you are cloning, the targets will be cloned if compatible with the proposal type you select. When starting a new proposal of an observing type, it will be created with 1 empty target that is assigned the default ACIS-S/None instrument configuration.  See <a href="#ObservationType"> Proposal Type</a>.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="CreateJoint">Has this proposal already been allocated Chandra time by the HST, NRAO, or XMM review panels?</a>
<br>This option should only be used if you have already been allocated Chandra time from  the HST, NRAO or XMM review panel. This means your proposal has been approved at the other review.

</ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="propmodify">Modify Selected</a>
<br>
Takes you to the editable proposal form. If you attempt to modify a proposal that has already
been submitted, you will first be asked to confirm that you intend to reset the proposal to 
"In progress".
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="propwithdraw">Withdraw/Restore Selected</a>
<br>
Allows you to restore a withdrawn proposal or withdraw an active proposal.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="viewpdf">View Proposal Form</a>
<br>
Generates and displays/downloads the pdf version of the selected proposal form.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="transferown">Transfer Ownership</a>
<br>
Allows you to transfer edit permission from yourself to another person who has an account.
Note they need to have opted in to the searchable list or you won't be able to find them.
</ul>

        <br>
        Check this box to view a summary of an estimate of the resource costs that your proposal will be requesting. In order to more accurately track the commitments associated with multi-cycle proposals, it is desirable that a separate score should be calculated for each cycle in which the proposal requests time. The output of the resource cost calculator has therefore been updated to include scores for the initial, and two following, cycles. At present, the scores for each cycle are weighted by the requested exposure in that cycle, and do not account for differences in visibility or constraints between cycles. 
        Please refer to the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/"> https://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/</a> for further details.

<fieldset class="fshelp" id="summary"><legend>Validation</legend>
  <ul>
    <li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Validation">Validation Results</a>
    <br>
    A table containing any errors or warnings that may impact the proposal. All errors must
    be fixed before you will be able to submit the proposal. The "Page" column tells you which
    portion of the proposal to review to find the cause of the error. The "Tgt" column will let you know if the error is specific to a target.
    You can click "View Results in New Window" to pop the validation results table up into 
    another browser window. Note that if you make a change in the proposal, you will need to 
    reload the separate window in order to view the latest validation results.
  </ul>

<fieldset class="fshelp" id="summary"><legend>Submit</legend>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="PeerReview">Would the P.I. be willing to participate in an upcoming Chandra peer review?</a>
<br>
Optional, and for CXC internal use only.
<p>
At the Chandra peer review, which normally takes place about three months after
the proposal deadline, a dozen panels review and discuss all submitted proposal
in specific science categories. Each panel includes 7 or 8 panelists and one
chair to assess about 60 proposals. Proposals are available to reviewers about
4 weeks prior to the review and the CXC requests that preliminary grades be
sent electronically in advance of the review to aid with prioritization of
discussion time during the review itself. For each proposal, a primary reviewer
is responsible for writing a short assessment which will be sent to the
proposer. The review takes 2 full days plus travel and time to read the
proposals in advance. Travel expenses are paid by the Chandra project.
<p>
Note that a Yes answer, while deeply appreciated, does not guarantee participation in an upcoming Chandra peer review, since the CXC must balance many factors and avoid conflicts when composing peer review panels.
Your answer will have no bearing on the success of your Chandra proposal(s).

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Submit"> I have reviewed my application and believe it to be ready for submission.</a>
<br> Check this box when your proposal is final. Then click the "Submit" button to submit the proposal. After you submit a proposal, you are returned to the CPS Home page.
