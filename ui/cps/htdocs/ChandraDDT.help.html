<fieldset class="fshelp" id="propcreate"><legend>Home</legend>
The Home page displays a table of proposals owned by or shared with the current user.  A gray background on a table row means the proposal is not editable but can be viewed.  They may be proposals you have withdrawn or submitted, are from previous cycles, or are proposals that someone else owns where you are listed as the Principal Investigator(PI) or as a Co-Investigator(CoI).

The "Own?" column indicates whether or not you are the person responsible for the proposal.
These are proposals that you are actively working on, or are proposals that you have submitted
or withdrawn.
You can only edit those proposals that you both own and that are in an editable state (e.g. not
withdrawn, not from a previous cycle).
