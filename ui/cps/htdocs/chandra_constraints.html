<fieldset class="fshelp" id="Constraints"><legend>Target Constraints</legend>


This section contains additional parameters for a time critical observation. 
<p>
If any constraint is required, the observation is considered time constrained 
and will be subject to the limits set for the number of approved constrained 
observations during the Chandra Peer Review.
<p>
<p>The types of constraint are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="lblhelp">Window:</span>In a fixed time-window
<li><span class="lblhelp">Roll:</span> Roll angle on the sky is constrained to a specified range
<li><span class="lblhelp">Phase dependent:</span> Observation of a periodically-varying target within a specified phase range
<li><span class="lblhelp">Grouping:</span> Single or multiple targets observed in any order and encompassed by a single time interval.
<li><span class="lblhelp">Coordinated Obs.:</span> Coordination with other observatories/telescopes
</ul>
On other pages:
<ul>
<li><span class="lblhelp">Offset/Pointings:</span> Pointing/offsets need to be modified based on the roll angle.
<li><span class="lblhelp">Uninterrupted:</span> Absolutely no interruptions
<li><span class="lblhelp">Split Interval:</span> Interval if observation needs to be split
<li><span class="lblhelp">Monitoring:</span> Repeated observations of a single target at specified intervals. 
<li><span class="lblhelp">TOO Followups:</span> Repeated observations of a TOO target at specified intervals.
<li><span class="lblhelp">Remarks:</span> Constraints are defined in the remarks because it is not possible to define them using the existing fields.
</ul>

'Monitoring', 'Grouping' and 'TOO Followup' observations are mutually exclusive.
<p>
<p>
  'Grouping' and 'Split Interval' observations are mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>
  'Uninterrupted' and 'Split Interval' observations are mutually exclusive.
</p>
<span class="warnmsg"><i>Note:</i></span>If any constraint is set to <b>Y</b>
(i.e., required), the observation is time
constrained and therefore subject to the limits set for the number of
approved constrained observations during the Chandra Peer Review.
<span class="warnmsg"><i>BEFORE SUBMISSION,  </i></span> please check the
SlewTax/Resources in the "Target Checks" section to estimate the 
constraint difficulty level
of each target and the total slew tax for your proposal.

<p>
You may want to use the
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/soft/provis/"> PRoVis </a>
tool to investigate Chandra spacecraft
roll, pitch and visibility for your target as a function of date.
Chandra Mission Planning schedules all observations, but information from
PRoVis can be especially useful for proposers whose observations require 
constraints.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="WindowConstraints"> Window Constraints</a>
<br>

These parameters indicate the earliest observation start time and the latest observation end time. <span class="warnmsg">USE THE LARGEST VIABLE WINDOW.</span>
Do not enter window constraints merely to indicate periods of sunblock, 
as these are accounted for by Chandra Mission Planning. 
<p>
The start and end times must be given in UT .
Up to 4 window constraints may be entered per observation.
See the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer">
Call for Proposals</a> document for the anticipated dates covered by this cycle. 
The window start/stop format is <i>dd-mon-yyyy hh:mm</i> where :
</p>
<pre>
    dd = day of month
   mon = 3 character abbreviation of month. Valid Values:
         Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec
  yyyy = full year (ie: 2019)
    hh = hours (valid values 0-23)
    mm = minutes (valid values 0-59)
</pre>

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="WindowConstraint"> Window Constraint?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating a window constraint exists for this observation.
<br>Options are: Y (Yes, required),  N (No).
When adding a constraint entry to the table, the default is Yes, required.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="WindowConstraintStart"> Window Constraint:  Start </a>
<br>
The time in UT specifying the earliest observation start time. 
Format is <i>dd-mon-yyyy&nbsp;hh:mm</i>.<br>
<i>Required</i> if <i>Window Constraint?</i> is 'Y' or 'P'.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="WindowConstraintStop"> Window Constraint:  Stop </a>
<br>
The time in UT specifying the latest observation end time. 
Format is <i>dd-mon-yyyy&nbsp;hh:mm</i>.<br>
<i>Required</i> if <i>Window Constraint?</i> is 'Y' or 'P'.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="RollConstraint"> Roll Constraints</a>
<br>
<p>The spacecraft roll is the angle between celestial north and the
spacecraft -Z (minus Z) axis projected on the sky, as measured from 
N through W. The roll angle is
constrained as a function of time for thermal control and because power 
must be supplied by the solar cells. For any given time and target, there 
is a nominal
roll angle for which the solar power arrays are aimed directly at the
sun.  
The nominal roll for a target may be displayed using 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/soft/provis/">PRoVis</a>, the
Chandra Pitch-Roll-Visibility tool, available on the web at
http://cxc.harvard.edu/soft/provis/. 
The Observation Visualizer (ObsVis)
further allows display of the Chandra instrument field-of-view on the sky, 
and is available
in the latest CIAO downloadable package at
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download</a>.

<p>A roll constraint translates directly into a constraint on the
day and time when an observation may be carried out.
It should only be specified for cases in which a specific attitude
is required to meet scientific objectives. 
The <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/soft/provis/">PRoVis</a> tool interactively plots roll angle as a function of time for a given target.
</p>
A maximum of 4 roll constraints may be entered.

the phase range will be covered.  Values must be between 0 and 0.5.  
<br><i>Required</i> if <i>Phase Dependent Observation?</i> is 'Y' or 'P'.

<br>
Maximum phase in the variable phenomenon to be observed.  
Values must be between 0 and 1.
<br>
(The Maximum Phase value may be less than the Minimum Phase value: this will 
be interpreted to mean that the observation could take place from the Minimum 
Phase through phase 0.0 to the Maximum Phase.)

<p>Options are: Y (Yes, required), N (No).
The default is 'N'.
<p> 
'Y' indicates that the science goals can only be achieved if the 
observation is not interrupted.  Use 'Y' sparingly, as this 
WILL BE COUNTED AS A CONSTRAINT.    
</p>
<p>	Note that for short observations, normal Chandra scheduling results 
in the allocated observing time being assigned to a single pointing, 
but there is no guarantee of this.
<p>Observations >180 ksec will have to be interrupted due to the satellite
orbit. If the uninterrupted flag is checked, the observations are 
constrained such that the pieces will be observed as contiguously as 
possible, and certainly in adjacent spacecraft orbits.

  <br>
  Relative Time Interval between observations if they need to be split; all observations are to 
  occur within this interval, from the beginning of the first to the end of the last. Use sparingly, as this <span class="warnmsg">WILL BE COUNTED AS A CONSTRAINT</span>. 
  <p>
    For non-Monitor Series observations, valid range is: 
    <a href="#TotalObservationTime">Total Observing Time</a> <= Split Interval  < 2 years.

  <p>
    If Monitor Series observation is chosen, a separate Split Interval value needs to be set for each observation in the monitor series. These values will override any value entered in the Observing Time box, Split Interval field.

of another observatory?</a>
Value indicating that the Chandra observations are to be coordinated
with another observatory.

Required if Coordinated Observation? is '<b>Y</b>es, Required' .
<p>
This is the maximum permitted interval encompassing the Chandra observation and
 those of the coordinating observatory(ies). The minimum value is the duration 
of the longer of the observations of either of two coordinating observatories,
