<fieldset class="fshelp" id="TOO"><legend>TOO Details</legend>

If this is the trigger target for a TOO, please specify the exact CXC response 
window, probability, and trigger criteria . These fields should 
NOT be specified if this target is a TOO followup, even if the followup 
specifies a different instrument configuration than the trigger target. The 
response to a TOO will be classified according to the minimum time delay 
between trigger and observation. The faster the Chandra response, the 
more difficult and the more limited the number of TOOs allowed. 

<ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="TOOCancel"> If this TOO is a resubmission of a proposal approved in the previous Cycle, should this TOO be canceled if the previous Cycle TOO is triggered?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating whether this TOO request should be canceled if a 
previously approved TOO is triggered.
Default is <b>N</b>o.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="TOOStart"> Exact CXC start/stop response window</a>
<br>
Start time is the minimum time after the official request to trigger the 
Chandra TOO observation that the exposure should begin.  
This <b>start</b> time will be used to determine the correct Peer Review category for TOO constraints.
Peer review Categories are: <b>0-5</b>, <b>5-20</b>, <b>20-40</b>, <b>&gt;=40</b>.
<table border='1'>
<tr>
<th class="th">Peer Review Category</th>
<th class="th">Response Window</th>

<tr> <td>Very Fast</td><td>0-5</td><td>0 &lt; <b>t</b> &lt; 5</td></tr>

</table>
<p>Stop time is the maximum time after that trigger for the exposure to begin and still be 
scientifically useful.
<p>
Units are days. 
<br><i>Required</i> for all trigger targets for TOOs.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="TOOProb">Probability of TOO occurring</a> 
<br>
Enter the probability of the TOO occurring during the proposed Chandra cycle.
The default is 1.0.  Valid values are 0.1 - 1.0.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="TOOTrigger">Exact TOO Trigger Criteria</a>
<br>
Specify the trigger criteria for the TOO, e.g. information that will
establish the trigger,such as how bright the source should be, 
in which instrument or 
telescope, minimum time above threshold brightness, etc..
<br> Maximum of 400 characters.  <i>Required</i> for all trigger targets for TOOs.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="AlternateGroup">Alternate Target Group Name</a> 
<br>
If this target has alternates or is an alternate please specify the name for
this group of alternate targets.  
<br>Maximum of 20 characters.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="AlternateNumber">Number of targets requested for this alternate group</a>
<br>
If you've specified an alternate group name, enter how many targets you are
requesting for this group. For example, if you want to observe 1 of 3 TOOs 
in this group, then the 3 TOO's should all specify the same group name 
(i.e.: alt1) and the number of targets requested would be '1'.
The alternate targets can then be added using the <b>Add Target</b>
button.  You must specify the identical group name for all the
alternate targets.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="TOOFollowupInstructions">TOO followup instructions</a>
<br>
Specify additional TOO followup instructions only if the 
<i>'Number of followup observations'</i> is greater than 0.
<br>Maximum of 1500 characters.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="toocoord">TOO Coordinated Observations:</a>
<br>

  Indicate all of the coordinated observations (simultaneous or 
  contemporaneous) associated with this TOO in the appropriate 
  box for coordination with other observatories. This
  includes observations already approved under other programs, 
  even if time is not requested as part of this proposal. 
  Coordinated observations included only in proposal text 
  will not be recognized or accepted.  For non-Chandra 
  observations approved after your Chandra proposal has 
  been  accepted, you may request coordination
  if and when you trigger your TOO.  Any such request for 
  additional coordination or observing constraints must be made 
  to the Director and approved by the Chandra Director's Office.
  For a constraint approved in this way, the CXC will try to 
  accommodate on a best efforts basis.
