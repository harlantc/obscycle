<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="ResponseTime">** Response Time Requested</a>
Please select the response time requested for this observation and then state
the justification in the <I>Justification of Response Time</I> field.
Options are: <pre>
<b>Slow</b>      &gt; 30 Days
<b>Medium</b>    &gt;  5 Days  and &lt;= 30 Days

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="ResponseTimeJust">** Justification of Response Time</a><br>
Please justify the response time requested. Should
it be observed as soon as possible, or in, say ten days' time?  The
Chandra team, upon receipt of an RfO, will make the decision whether to
go to the target.  Agreement results in implementation, without
further consultation with the PI.  Therefore, please make sure that
your proposal includes all information required to actually plan and
schedule the entire observation, as you may not have an opportunity
for additional feedback or information before the observation occurs.

<I>Required</I>.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="ContactInfo">** 24 Hour Contact Information</a><br>

information such as which contact information to use for what
days/times.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="JustTarget">** Justification for this Particular Target</a><br>
Please state why this particular target should be
observed, i.e., why it is a good example of the phenomena addressed in
the proposal.
<br>Maximum of 200 characters.  Characters beyond this limit will be
truncated.  <I>Required</I>.
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="WhyNotCfP">** Why can't the observation wait for the next CfP?</a><br>
Please state why it is necessary to interrupt the approved observation schedule
to carry out this proposal now rather than wait for the next Chandra Call for
Proposals (CfP).
<br>Maximum of 400 characters.  Characters beyond this limit will be

<I>Required</I>.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Transient Behavior">** If Transient, Likelihood of Detection, Duration, and Recurrence of Transient Behavior</a>
Please provide estimates of a) how likely it is
that Chandra will observe the transient behavior; b) the duration of the
transient behavior; c) its likelihood of recurrence.
