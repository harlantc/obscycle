Maximum size is 10M. Required.

 The Science Justification may not exceed the allowed number of pages as 
defined in the <a href="http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/">Chandra CfP</a

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="cvupload">Team Expertise</a>
<br>
Proposers are required to upload a separate "Team Expertise" (TE) PDF document which is not anonymized. There is a limit
of 4 pages but in many cases 1-2 paragraphs will be sufficient. This document will be reviewed by the panels after the
final ranking for proposals that are likely to be accepted. The TE document should contain a list of team members,
their broad areas of expertise, and the contribution each team member will make to the proposed investigation. For
proposals with a large number of collaborators, it is not necessary to report on the qualifications of every team
member. In that case a broad description of the work to be done by groups is sufficient (for example, "Drs Cannon,
Leavitt and Payne-Gaposchkin will be responsible for modeling the soft stellar X-ray component").
