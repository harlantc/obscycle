<ul>
<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="Detector"> Detector</a>
<br>
Specifies which detector will be on the optical axis during the observation.
The choices are: ACIS-S, ACIS-I, HRC-S or HRC-I.  See the 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap7.html">HRC</a> and 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html">ACIS</a> 
chapters of the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/">Proposer's Observatory Guide</a> 
for the aimpoint locations.

<p>The target coordinates, including any specified offsets, will be
placed at the aimpoint of the selected detector. Note a user should
use the offset parameters (above) to move the target away from the nominal
aimpoint should this be desired. 

<pre>
Nominal aim points:
    ACIS-I:  aim point on chip I3
    ACIS-S:  aim point on chip S3, +.1667 arcmin Y offset
    HRC-I :  Detector center
    HRC-S :  1.3 arcmin from detector center to minimize effect of MCP
             boundaries
</pre>


<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Grating"> Grating</a>
<br>
Specifies which grating to use.  Grating options are NONE, HETG, and
LETG.  The default is NONE which specifies no grating (direct imaging).
You should use ACIS-S with the HETG and HRC-S with the LETG, unless
you make a case otherwise in your proposal.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="HRCTimingMode"> HRC Timing Mode</a>
<br>
Observers who wish to perform timing studies with the HRC should select
this mode. This timing mode for HRC consists of using the HRC-S detector in
what is called the Imaging Mode. In this mode, only the center segment of the
HRC-S is active. The overall detector background is currently about 
50 counts/sec (this is because of the overall background reduction 
associated with high solar activity reducing the Cosmic Ray flux). 
Sources with rates up to the telemetry limit (184 counts/sec) can be 
observed with no lost events and fully correct times. It is not advisable 
to look at very bright sources that actually come within about 10-15% 
of the telemetry limit to avoid the occasional statistical
fluctuations that might cause the loss of some events. It is also not
advisable to look at very strong point sources due to count rate 
limitations on the HRC (for HRC-S this is about 20-30 counts/sec).


<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="CountRate"> Source Count Rate</a>
<br>
The Source Count Rate box must be filled in by all users.  For detectors without
gratings, this count rate is the source count rate in counts per second.
For ACIS-S+grating or HRC-S+grating, this count rate is the zero-order count 
rate in counts per second.
All count rates are to be specified as observed (not pile-up corrected).

<p>For variable sources, supply the maximum expected count rate.  This will 
allow for consistency checking of requested observation mode(s).  The 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/pimms.jsp">PIMMS</a> tool can be used to calculate count rate.

<I> Required for all observations that use gratings.</i>

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="TotalFieldCountRate"> Total Field Count Rate</a>

<p>
  The ACIS CCD chip layout is as pictured. ACIS can read out a maximum of 6 chips.
  Each required chip should be set to 'Y', up to a maximum of 4.
  <p>If a chip is desirable, but the primary science could still be
 accomplished without it, please identify that chip as optional
 so that the CXC can optimize scheduling given thermal operating
 constraints.  This is accomplished by specifying Off# (instead of
 'Y' or 'N'), where # represents the turn-off order of the optional
 chips selected, i.e., if thermal constraints dictate that one of your
 selected optional chips be turned off, that will be Off1.  If two
 must be turned off, then both Off1 and Off2 will be turned off.
 <p>
The CXC recommends that you specify no more than 4 required CCDs
("Y" = required) if your science objectives can be met with 4 or fewer CCDs.
If 4 CCDs are specified as required, the GO may specify up to 2 optional CCDs
to bring the total of required plus optional CCDs to a maximum of 6 CCDs, 
but the GO
should be aware that optional CCDs may be turned off once the thermal
environment is known at the time the short term schedule is generated.  
GOs may still request a total of 6 CCDs, but only 4 CCDs may be required and up to 2 CCDs must be optional.
If the science requires 5 or 6 CCDs, proposers should  state this in the Remarks field.
Chips set to 'N' will not be used for the given observation.

</p>
Values are:
<ul>
    <li> unselected - do not use this chip
    <li> N - do not use this chip
    <li> Y - Chip is required.
    <li> Off# - Chip is optional and the number '#' (1 through 5) is the
order in which the user would prefer the CCDs be turned off. For
example, Off1 should be the first optional CCD, meaning that it should be
the <b>first optional CCD to be turned off</b>.  
</ul>
<br>In summary,
<pre>
  min 1, max 4 chips may be required (selected as 'Y')
  min 0, max 5 chips may be optional  (selected as 'Off#')
  max 6 chips total may be turned on (Y + Off#)
  min 4, max 9 chips may be turned off  (selected as 'N')
</pre>

A description of optional chips, including motivations and some recommended chip sets can be found in the ACIS chapter of the <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap6.html">POG</a>.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="confirmChip">I have reviewed the selection of ACIS chips and identified any chips whose operation is optional </a>

This field is required if more than 1 chip is selected.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Spectra">What is the maximum number of counts you expect in any of the spectra you will analyze from this observation?</a>
<br>
Total maximum expected number of counts for any spectrum to be
scientifically analyzed from this observation.  Default is blank.  
Input is required for any ACIS-I non-grating observation.
Valid range is 1 - 100000.


<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="MultSpectral">Do you expect to analyze more than 2 resolved spectral lines in that spectrum?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating whether or not more than 2 resolved spectral lines
are expected in the brightest spectrum to be analyzed from this observation.
Default is blank.  'Y' or 'N' is required for any ACIS-I non-grating 
observation.

Both the two questions above are asked to trigger assessment of the 
sensitivity of ACIS-I imaging observations to gain calibration.  Science 
from high S/N ACIS-I imaging spectroscopy (no gratings) with 
rich spectra may be affected by thermally-induced gain drifts.  
As spacecraft/environment/analysis evolves, CXC may determine 
that appropriate scheduling (treated as a preference, not as a constraint)
can minimize such thermal impacts.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="Use most efficient values"> Use most efficient frame exposure time?</a>

<br>
Logical value indicating use of the most efficient values for the CCD Frame

'Y' is required for <i>CC</i> exposure mode.
The default is 'Y'.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="FrameTime"> CCD Frame Exposure Time</a>
<br>
The CCD frame exposure time is the fundamental unit for ACIS . It ranges
from 0.0 to 10.0 seconds in 0.1 second increments.  The default frame time is 3.2 seconds.
<p>Responding with a `Y' to the question `Use most efficient frame exposure
time?'
allows the ACIS team to adjust the CCD frame time as necessary. The user may
override that freedom by specifying a CCD frame time. Note that an entire CCD
takes 3 seconds to read, so a 0.2 second
frame time has a small observing efficiency which the proposer must justify.
A shorter frame time can aid in
mitigating pileup by a factor of up to 8. A shorter frame time is most
easily achieved by the use of a Subarray.
<br>Valid values: 0.0 to 10.0 seconds in 0.1 second increments depending
on the number of active CCD's. The minimum times depend on the number of 
CCDs as follows:
<pre>
1 or 2 CCDs	- 0.1 second
3 or 4 CCDs	- 0.2 seconds
5 or 6 CCDs	- 0.3 seconds

Logical value indicating use of alternating exposure readout.

The default is 'N'.

<p>Alternating Exposure Readout observation sets the number of SECONDARY
exposures that will follow each primary exposure. If n = 0, only primary
exposures are used. A deadtime will result from the short exposure since the
electronics still require 3.2 sec to process the full frame. Therefore, to
minimize the deadtime, the number of short exposures should be kept to a
minimum. The fraction of time during which data are taken is the ratio of
the selected frame time to the sum of this and the nominal frametime: e.g.
for a new frametime of n (<3.2) secs, the fraction of time during which data
are taken is n/(3.2+n). Note the minimum on the primary exposure is 0.2 sec.
Times longer than 3.2 seconds are discouraged until operational
experience exists.


<p>
An example is useful. Suppose you want to sample the image in a repeated
cycle of 4 exposures with a primary exposure time of 0.3 sec. If all 6 CCDs
are active the secondary exposure time will be 3.2 sec. The resulting
sequence of exposures will be 0.3 sec, 3.2 sec, 3.2 sec, 3.2 sec, 0.3 sec,

<fieldset class="fshelp" id="ACIStelem"><legend>ACIS Optional Parameters that affect TELEMETRY</legend>
Before event candidates are written to telemetry, they are subjected to three sets of
filters, each of which can cause them to be rejected. The filters can reject events by their
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/ACIS.html#sec:acis_grades"><b>grade code</b></a>*, by their
<a href="#UseEnergyFilter"><b>energy</b></a>, and by their
<a href="#UseSpatialWindow"><b>spatial location</b></a> on the CCD array.
The order in which these filters are applied is unimportant.
<p>
* At the present time, the proposer cannot change the set of grade
codes to be rejected by the on-board grade filter; they were chosen to exclude
only those event candidates that are almost certainly <i>not</i> caused by
target X-rays. This is discussed in the
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/ACIS.html#subsec:acis_non_xrb">
Non-X-ray Background</a> section of the

</p>
<ul>
<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="UseEnergyFilter"> Energy Filter: Use Custom Event Energy Filter</a>
<br>
  All event candidates from all CCDs are filtered by energy before they are packed
  into the telemetry stream. This does <i>not</i> affect pulse pileup: it only
  reduces the telemetry. When this field contains 'N', the filter rejects only
  those events with energies below 0.24 keV for ACIS-S and below .36 keV for ACIS-I.
  The filter also rejects those events with energies above (the lower threshold + 13 keV).
  <p>
  When the field
  contains 'Y', the proposer gets to specify more restrictive values of
  <a href="#LowerEnergyThreshold">Lower Energy Threshold</a> and
  <a href="#EnergyFilterRange">Energy Filter Range</a>.
  (<b>Note:</b> additional energy filtering may be applied to events that fall
  within particular <a href="#LowerThresholdforWindow">spatial windows</a>, as
  described below. Such events will be rejected if they fail <i>either</i> filter.)

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp"  name="LowerEnergyThreshold"> Energy Filter:  Lower Energy Threshold</a>
<br>
  Event candidates will be rejected if their energy lies below this value.
  <br>Units are keV; the valid range is 0.24 - 15.0 keV.
  <p>For ACIS-S the minimum threshold is 0.24 keV
  <br>For ACIS-I the minimum threshold is 0.36 keV
  <br>ACIS is insensitive to X-rays below these energies.

  (Lower&nbsp;Energy&nbsp;Threshold&nbsp;+&nbsp;Energy&nbsp;Filter&nbsp;Range).
  <br>The effective area of the Chandra mirrors above 10 keV is essentially zero,
  but X-ray pileup can result in event candidates with energies above 10 keV.
  <br>Units are keV; the valid range is 0.1 - 15.0 keV.

<li class="elehelp"><a class="lblhelp" name="UseSpatialWindow"> Use Spatial Windows?</a>

  <p>
   By setting this field to 'Y', the user can specify one or more spatial
   window filters -- rectangular regions on specific chips -- within which
   event candidates can be rejected according to their energy or to their
   frequency of occurrence. The use of spatial windows does <i>not</i> affect
   the way the CCD is read out, so there will be no impact on event pile-up.
   Spatial windows will reduce the telemetry volume by removing event candidates.
  </p>
  <p>
   As many as six spatial windows may be specified for each chip. If windows
   overlap, the order in which they are defined in the CPS form is important:
   for each event candidate centered at (CHIPX=<i>x</i>, CHIPY=<i>y</i>), the
   on-board software examines all spatial windows defined for that chip,
   <i>in the order specified in the CPS form, lowest index first</i>, and
   decides whether to
   reject the event based on the parameters in the <i>first</i> window that
   contains that (<i>x,y</i>). If the event lies outside all windows, it
   will not be rejected by the window filter.
