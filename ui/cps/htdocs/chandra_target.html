<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="TargetName"> Target Name</a>
<br>
Targets are frequently searched for in the database by common names, such as
"NGC 4051" . This is common practice by our archival users. Therefore, these
common names should be used as the target name.  *Append* any additional 
target info (e.g., NGC 4051 field 2).
In the absence of a common name, any other IAU-sanctioned name may be
used (http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/).
<p>
You may choose to use the Name Resolver button to fill in the object coordinates from the selected catalog, or you can enter the information manually. 
In order to ensure that new Chandra observations can be unequivocally identified 
through both their coordinates and target names during their exclusive use 
period and when they will become public, we encourage proposers to follow our 
<a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cda/targetnames.html">guidelines</a> on how 
to select informative, standard, and resolvable target names.
<br>Maximum of 30 characters. <I>Required for all except Solar System Object</I>

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="SolarSystemObject"> Solar System Object</a>
<br>
The name of the Solar System Object to be observed, from the following
choices: None, Asteroid, Comet, Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Moon, Neptune, Pluto, 
Saturn, Uranus or Venus. 

<P>The default is 'None'.  Observations of moving solar system objects
are made with a sequence of pointed observations, with the object
moving through the field of view during each dwell period.  The sequence
of pointings will be derived from the object ephemeris to ensure that
the object remains within 5' of the Chandra line-of-sight.  Most solar
system objects move slowly enough so that a single pointing will
suffice.  Should your observation be selected then the CXC will work
with you to produce an observation that both meets your scientific
objectives and optimizes the use of Chandra.


<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="TargetPosition"> Is target position known and fixed?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating target position is known for this 
target.  Modify value to 'N' if target position is unknown for
this TOO or Solar System Object.
             
<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="R.A."> R.A.</a>
<br>
The Right Ascension of the source in mandatory J2000 coordinate system at the current epoch. 
Offsets from this position may be specified using the Y/Z Detector Offset field.
The standard format is HH MM SS.S - hours, minutes, seconds, separated by 
spaces. Alternatively, it may be entered as degrees (DDD.DDDDDD), in 
which case it will be converted to sexagesimal during verification. The 
seconds may be entered as a real value with tenths (i.e., SS.S). 
<br><I>Required</I>, except for Solar System Objects and TOO's of unknown
position.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="Dec"> Dec.</a>
<br>
The declination of the source in mandatory J2000 coordinate system at the current epoch.  Offsets
from this position may be specified using the Y/Z Detector Offset field. The 
standard format is +/-DD MM SS.S - sign, degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds, 
separated by spaces.  Alternatively, it may be entered 
as degrees (+/-DD.DDDDD), in which case it will be converted to sexagesimal 
during verification.  If no sign is given it will be assumed to be positive. 
<br><I>Required</I>, except for Solar System Objects and TOO's of unknown
position.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="Ecliptic">High Ecliptic Latitude </a>
Targets at high ecliptic latitude result in heating of the ACA. Times at high eclipitic latitude are limited. 
You may use the <a href="/toolkit/precess.jsp">Precess</a> tool to check your coordinates.


<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="photometry"> Do you want optical monitor data for your target?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating whether optical data from the aspect camera is
requested for this observation. The default is 'N'.

<P>The proposer should be aware that the aspect camera is NOT optimized
for optical monitoring.  Please see the 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/">Proposer's Observatory Guide</a> 
for the limitations on the photometry and the expected signal-to-noise ratios
(chapter on <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap5.html">Aspect system </a>).

<P>The use of one of the guide-star channels as an optical monitor will be 
subject to peer review. The degradation of the aspect solution may lower the
usefulness of the archive of the field.  This will be weighed with the 
scientific value of the optical data. 

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="VMag"> V Magnitude of Target</a>
<br>
Specify the V magnitude of the target if the use of the optical monitor is
desired. Valid range is -15.0 -  20.0.
<I>Required if optical monitor flag is set to "Y"</I>



<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="TargetOffsets"> Offset Pointing (Y/Z Detector Target Offset )</a>
<br>
The user may wish to offset-point the observatory pointing for a
number of reasons, e.g., to reduce the effects of ACIS pile-up or to
avoid HRC pore limits by blurring the image. Offset pointing is
discussed in Chapter 3 of the 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap3.html">
Proposer's Observatory Guide(POG)  </a>.
<p>
In general however, most observers/proposers should leave BLANK all detector offsets in CPS if they wish their target to be close to the optical axis (best focus position). For a detailed discussion about the position of the optical axis and the default aimpoint please refer to <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap4.html#sec:hrma_oxap">section 4.5 in the POG</a> .
<p>
A positive Z offset moves the target from ACIS-I towards ACIS-S. A
positive Y offset moves the target from chip S3 towards chip S2. (see
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap3.html">
POG</a> Figure 3.1). Note the 180 degree difference between the Y/Z
coordinates and the Delta-Y/Delta-Z coordinates. 
 
<p>
Note that the RA and Dec of the optical axis will depend upon the
spacecraft roll angle at the time of the observation. If the observer
wants the optical axis at a particular RA and Dec with a YZ target
offset, then the observer must specify a roll constraint.
<p>
All units are arcmins. The overall valid range is -50.0 to +50.0 for
(y,z) offsets. Thus it is possible to specify an offset so large that
the target is not imaged anywhere on the detector, so exercise
caution. Furthermore, if the target is offset by more than 15 arcmins,
then ghost images (see <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/POG/html/chap4.html#sec:hrma_ghost">POG</a> Chapter 4) from the target may be visible.
<p>
Finally, offsets are implemented in software by redefining the
pointing position. This means that roll constraints apply at the new
position.
<p>


<b><u>Y  Pointing Offset:</u></b>
<br><b>Sense:</b> negative Y offset moves the target away from the 
aimpoint in the direction of S4 on ACIS-S (ie. further onto the S3 chip)
<p>
<b><u>Z  Pointing Offset:</u></b>
<br><b>Sense:</b> positive Z offset moves the target towards the readouts in 
ACIS-S (i.e. away from ACIS-I)
<p>
<b>Recommendations:</b> 
<br>
Any numeric value entered in the box will override the default values.
<p>
Proposers/observers who require specific offsets from the default aimpoint 
should enter into CPS Y,Z offsets in arcmin relative to the new aimpoint .
This is most likely to affect gratings observers who wish to 
optimize the position of chip gaps along the 
spectrum of their source. 
<p>

WARNING: It is quite possible to specify an offset so large that the 
target is not imaged anywhere on the detector, so exercise caution.   To make sure your 
target is placed as desired, we recommend use of the Observation 
Visualizer(ObsVis) available in the latest CIAO downloadable package at 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download</a>.
Note that CPS software forbids entry of offsets larger than 10/30/20/50arcmin
for ACIS-I/ACIS-S/HRC-I/HRC-S.


<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="SIMTransOffset"> SIM Translation Offset</a>
<br>
Offset from nominal translation position.  
This is a motion of the SIM and thus the aimpoint away from the
default position on the detector along the z-axis (which is along the
axis from ACIS-S to ACIS-I).
<p>
Warning: The standard sub-arrays DO NOT take into account these recommended 
offsets. Thus if you wish to use a sub-array in conjunction with one of these
offsets, you will need to specify it explicitly as a custom sub-array. For 
recommended values please see the web pages: 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Letg/ACIS_params/">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Letg/ACIS_params</a>
for recommended offsets for LETG/ACIS-S gratings observations and
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/ASC/calib/hetgsubarray.html">
http://space.mit.edu/ASC/calib/hetgsubarray.html</a> 
for the HETG.
<p>
Units are in millimeters.
	
<pre>
Sense: a negative motion moves the aimpoint (and the target) towards the 
       readouts on ACIS-S (ie. away from ACIS-I)

Units: mm (scale 2.93mm/arcmin)

</pre>


<p>Valid values by detector are:

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="OffsetConstraint">Does the offset/pointing need to be adjusted once the observing roll angle is determined?</a>
<br>
Value indicating that the final pointing information/offsets need to be modified
based upon the roll angle.
If you have answered <b>YES</b> and this proposal is approved, the CXC will request detailed offset and pointing values shortly after results are announced. 
This <span class="warnmsg">WILL BE COUNTED AS A CONSTRAINT</span>.
<p>
<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="Grid"> Is the observation (part of) a grid?</a>
<br>
Logical value indicating whether this target is part of a grid of
pointings. The default is 'N'. The observer is advised that there will
be a reduction in the slew tax charged for a series of contiguous or
nearly contiguous pointings each separated by no more than a degree
from its nearest neighbor (a grid), provided that there is no
instrument set-up or observing mode change.  Proposer MUST provide a
detailed description of the grid positions (preferably a figure) 
in the science justification. Please refer to the CfP 
<a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/</a> for details.
<p>
Grids may be entered as separate targets.  Alternately, for a
large number of pointings with identical observing parameters, you may
specify all pointings by entering the grid center (the average
coordinates of all grid pointings) in the R.A. and Dec fields above,
and then also specifying the  3 general grid parameters below.  This
shortens and simplifies the proposal, but still allows target
duplication checks and proper accounting of time and targets at peer
review.  Approved programs will be required to provide exact pointings
within the grid to the CXC. 

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="GridName"> Unique Grid name</a>
<br> 
A unique grid name allows the pointings in a grid to be more easily
associated, scheduled, or searched as an ensemble in the CXC
database. Required for all pointings intended to be part of a grid.   
Maximum of 30 characters. 

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="GridPointings"> Number of grid pointings</a>
<br> 
The total number of grid pointings.
Input of this datum indicates that the proposer wishes
to use the parameterized generation of grid pointings for proposal 
purposes, rather than individual target pages.  Default is blank.
If grid parameters are used, the minimum value is 2.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="GridRadius"> Distance from center to farthest grid pointing (degrees)</a>
<br> 	
Distance in degrees between the center (average) grid coordinates
entered in the R.A. and Dec fields above, and the intended pointing
that is farthest from that center.  Maximum value is numerically
equal to the number of pointings.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="TriggerTarget"> Is this the trigger target for a TOO?</a>
<br>
If this target is the trigger target (first observation) for a TOO, 
please set the value to
 <b>Y</b>es.
If this target defines a different instrument configuration for a TOO followup observation, please set the value to <b>N</b>o.  
<p>
If a different instrument configuration or offset is required for a
followup, you must enter that observation as a new target with all
observational parameters specified, setting the <i>Total Observing Time</i>
to 0 and <i>Is this the trigger target for a TOO?</i> to 'N'(No).  
For non-trigger target forms, all other fields in the TOO Details
section must be blank.  Be sure to enter the correct target number for
each followup observation in the Followup Summary table of the
trigger observation. Target Number MUST be specified for every followup.
<p>
All followup observations whose ideal spacing is best determined from
measurements by Chandra or other observatories near the time of the trigger
will be classified as TOOs in the appropriate time delay category.
Followup observations which translate into potential fast TOOs and are not
fully specified and accounted for in the target forms will not be accepted.
<p>

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="TotalObservationTime"> Total Observing Time</a>
<br>
The total exposure time in kiloseconds for requested observation(s)
of this target.  For followups, monitoring observations or grids, this is the sum of 
all pointings. For example, for two observations of 40 kiloseconds each, 
specify 80 kiloseconds as the Total Observing Time and 2 for the Number of 
Observations in the 'Constraints' section.
<p>Individual exposures may need to be segmented. 
       If an observation that is uninterrupted (or at worst
       contiguous across orbits) is required, proposers must set the
       <a href="#UninterruptedObservation">Uninterrupted constraint flag</a>.

<p> Observations &gt;180 ksec will <b>have</b> to be interrupted due to the
satellite orbit. If the <i>Uninterrupted Observation Required</i> flag is 
checked, the pieces will be
observed as contiguously as possible, and certainly in adjacent
spacecraft orbits.
<p>
Valid range for an observing proposal is 1 - 10000 kiloseconds.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="MultiCycleTgt"> Multi-Cycle Targets: Projected Observing Time for Future Cycles</a>
<br>

If multi-cycle observations are requested for a given target, the
proposer must specify the observing constraints that require 
the observations to extend into future cycles.  Constraints
must be well-justified scientifically.  The PI must estimate based on 
these constraints the amount of time required in the subsequent cycles for
each such target, assuming the earliest feasible start date for
the first target observations.  

For accounting purposes, the cycles are defined as 01-January through 31-December, where the first available cycle begins the January after the proposal is approved.
<p>
The proprietary period for data from multi-cycle targets
begins when 90% of the data for any given target (as allocated to each
cycle) has been made available to the observer.

<li class="elehelp"> <a class="lblhelp" name="MonitoringObservation"> Monitoring and Followup Observations</a>

If more than 1 observation of this target is required, 
specify the desired number of observations below.
Please specify the exposure time and the minimum/maximum interval in days for 
which each observation should be spaced from its preceding observation.
Required observations will count as constrained at the Chandra Peer Review
