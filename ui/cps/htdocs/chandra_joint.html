Optional.  The Joint Proposal section should <b>ONLY</b> be filled out if
this is a
joint proposal which also requests time on one or more of the facilities
listed below. Please refer to the information on Joint Proposals in the 
Chandra <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer/CfP/">Call for Proposals</a>
and/or on the Proposer page: <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer">
http://cxc.harvard.edu/proposer</a>.
If proposing joint time for future cycles, include the
total joint observing time request across all cycles here.
The specific joint observatory requests by cycle must
be described in the Remarks fields of the Target pages.

<p>A small amount of observing time has been reserved in the programs of
HST, NRAO, XMM, and Chandra to be awarded by the review panels of
the other observatories Users may apply to HST, NRAO, or XMM and be
awarded Chandra time and vice versa. 
<p>Those proposing for Chandra time in response to this call may also apply
for time from the following facilities:

<p><b>No</b> Joint time will be allocated by the Chandra peer review without allocation of Chandra time except in the case 
of winning <i>Archive</i> proposals that request NOAO night(s).
</p>
<p>Multicycle proposals requesting joint time may be allocated up to 10% of cycleN+1 and 5% of cycleN+2 of the available joint time 
if scientifically justified (subject to the continued availability of
that time).  If proposing joint time for future cycles, include
the total joint observing time request across all cycles.
</p>
<b>Note:</b> If close coordination between space-based observatories is required,
you should set the
<a href="#Telescopes"><i>Must this observation be coordinated with that
of another space-based observatory?</i></a> 
option to Y, whether or not your
current proposal requests joint time awarded through Chandra.
